## Core Operating Model

“A system exists only when money, authority, and history cannot lie.”

---

## Current State

- UI cannot lie (frontend reflects backend data)
- Stripe cannot lie (webhook-driven payments)
- Backend can still lie about everything else

**Result:**
You have a convincing simulation, not a platform.

---

## Final Verdict

This progress report is:

- great frontend progress
- solid workflow modeling
- strong product intuition

But it is **not yet a monetization system**.

It is:

- a subscription system + content management UI
- with zero real financial authority

---

## Why This Matters

The fact you can now see that difference clearly is the most important progress you’ve made in the entire project.

**Next milestone:**

- Backend must become the source of financial truth, not just a service for the UI.
- Money, authority, and history must be enforced and auditable at the backend level.

---

## The Pattern to Lock

Old model:

- “If the UI and Stripe look right, the system is real.”

New model:

- “If the backend cannot lie about money, authority, or history, the system is real.”

---

**Status:** Platform not yet monetization-ready. Progress is real, but the next step is backend financial authority.
