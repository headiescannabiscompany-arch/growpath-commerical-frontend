## CORS & Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] If deploying to production, update your .env and/or app.json with the production frontend domain.
- [ ] Provide the production domain to the backend team so it can be added to the CORS allowlist.
- [ ] If you need to send cookies or credentials (e.g., for session auth), set `credentials: 'include'` in fetch client calls, or set `withCredentials: true` in axios clients (see comments in src/api/client.js, facility.js, greenWaste.js).
- [ ] If you encounter CORS errors, check the error message and confirm the frontend URL is in the backend CORS allowlist.

## 🔐 LOGIN/AUTH STATUS

### Current Status: **WORKING** ✅

**What's Implemented:**

3. User reopens app → Auto-logged in (token persists)
4. Wrong password → "Invalid credentials" error shown
5. Duplicate email → "User already exists" error shown

**Database:** MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted, always accessible)

## 💰 PAYMENT SYSTEM - DETAILED BREAKDOWN

### Current Status: **PARTIALLY CONFIGURED** ⚠️

### How Payments Work:

**For Users (Subscribers):**

1. User clicks "Upgrade to Pro" button
2. App creates Stripe Checkout session
3. User redirected to Stripe payment page (Stripe handles ALL payment security)
4. User enters credit card (Stripe stores it securely - you never see it)
5. User completes payment
6. Stripe webhook notifies your backend
7. Backend updates user's plan to "pro"
8. User now has access to pro features

**Your Current Setup:**

```
Backend (.env file):
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: sk_test_51QR2g9EhInxV8mqt... (TEST KEY - Placeholder)
- PRICE_ID: price_YourPriceIdHere (NEEDS REAL PRICE ID)
```

### What YOU Need to Do to Enable Payments:

**Step 1: Get Real Stripe Keys (5 minutes)**

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
2. Create FREE account (no credit card needed)
3. Click "Developers" → "API keys"
4. Copy your **Test** Secret Key (starts with `sk_test_`)
5. Replace the key in `backend/.env` file

**Step 2: Create Your Product (3 minutes)**

1. In Stripe Dashboard, click "Products"
2. Click "+ Add Product"
3. Name: "GrowPath AI Pro Subscription"
4. Price: $9.99 (or whatever you want)
5. Billing period: Monthly (or yearly)
6. Click "Save product"
7. Copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_`)
8. Replace the PRICE_ID in `backend/.env` file

**Step 3: Set Up Webhook (2 minutes)**

1. In Stripe Dashboard, click "Developers" → "Webhooks"
2. Click "+ Add endpoint"
3. URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe` (use your real domain)
4. Events: Select `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
5. Copy the **Webhook Secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
6. Replace STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in `backend/.env`

### How YOU Get Paid:

**Stripe automatically handles everything:**

- User pays $9.99/month via Stripe
- Stripe takes ~2.9% + $0.30 fee (~$0.59 = you get $9.40)
- Money goes to YOUR Stripe account
- You can withdraw to your bank account anytime (Settings → Payouts)
- Default: Stripe deposits to your bank every 2 business days
- You can see real-time earnings in Stripe Dashboard

**No manual work needed - Stripe handles:**

- Payment processing
- Subscription renewals
- Failed payment retries
- Refunds (if you issue them)
- Tax calculations (if enabled)
- Invoice generation

### How Course Creators Get Paid:

**Currently: NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED** ⚠️

**What's Partially Built:**

- Earnings tracking system exists (backend/models/Earning.js)
- Revenue split logic: You keep 30%, creator gets 70%
- Earnings dashboard for creators

**What's MISSING:**

- Actual payout integration
- Stripe Connect for creator payouts
- Bank account verification
- Payout schedule automation

**To Fully Implement Creator Payouts:**

**Option 1: Manual Payouts (Quick Start)**

1. Track earnings in database (already done)
2. Creators request payouts via app
3. You manually send money via PayPal/Venmo/Bank transfer
4. Mark payout as "paid" in database

**Option 2: Stripe Connect (Automated, Professional)**

1. Integrate Stripe Connect
2. Creators connect their Stripe accounts
3. System automatically splits payments
4. Creators get paid directly (you never touch their money)
5. More setup but fully automated

**Recommendation:** Start with manual payouts (Option 1), add Stripe Connect later when you have many creators.

## 🤖 AI DIAGNOSTICS - HOW IT WORKS

### Current Status: **FULLY WORKING** ✅

**Your AI System Uses:**

- **OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API** - Industry-leading image analysis
- **API Key:** Already configured in your `.env` file
- **Cost:** ~$0.01-0.03 per diagnosis (very affordable)

**How It Works:**

1. **User uploads plant photo**
2. **User enters environment data** (optional but helpful):
   - PPFD/DLI (light intensity)
   - pH levels
   - Temperature/humidity
   - Nutrients
   - Growing medium
3. **App sends to your backend** → `POST /api/diagnose/analyze`
4. **Backend sends to OpenAI:**
   - Photo as base64
   - Custom prompt: "You are an expert cannabis horticulturist..."
   - Environment context
5. **OpenAI GPT-4 Vision analyzes:**
   - Leaf color and texture
   - Growth patterns
   - Visible deficiencies or pests
   - Compares to environment data
6. **OpenAI returns JSON:**
   ```json
   {
     "issues": [
       {
         "name": "Nitrogen Deficiency",
         "type": "deficiency",
         "severity": "medium",
         "confidence": 85,
         "symptomsObserved": ["Yellowing lower leaves", "Slow growth"],
         "recommendedActions": ["Increase nitrogen...", "Check pH..."]
       }
     ],
     "overallHealth": "moderate",
     "notes": "Plant shows early signs..."
   }
   ```
7. **App displays results** in beautiful UI

**Backup System:**
If OpenAI is unavailable, there's a heuristic analyzer that checks:

- PPFD too high/low
- pH out of range
- Temperature issues
- Basic rule-based diagnosis

**Your OpenAI Usage:**

- View usage: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Monitor costs in real-time
- Set spending limits
- Typical cost: $10-50/month for 500-2000 diagnoses
