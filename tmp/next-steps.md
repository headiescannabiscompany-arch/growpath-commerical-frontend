# Next Steps (Short)

## Now (<= 3 hours)
1. Verify quarantine files are unused in src/tests.
2. Decide: delete or keep `src/api/_quarantine`.
3. Decide: keep API JS canonical; optional TS re-export from JS.
4. Commit + push when network is available.

## Decisions Needed
- Delete quarantine folder after verification? (yes/no)
- Re-export API TS from JS? (yes/no)
