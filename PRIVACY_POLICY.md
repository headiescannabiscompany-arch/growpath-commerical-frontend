## Introduction

GrowPath AI is a cultivation operations platform providing tools for personal growers, commercial creators, and multi-user facilities. This policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard data across all usage modes.

---

## Categories of Data

GrowPath AI processes two primary categories of data:

### 1. Personal User Data

Data associated with individual user accounts:

- Email address, username, password
- Profile information
- Community posts, comments, course content
- Payment data (processed by Stripe)
  This data is subject to deletion and export rights.

### 2. Facility Operational Data (Non-Personal)

Data generated by facility operations:

- Audit logs
- SOP templates and version history
- Task records
- Verification records
- Deviation reports
- Green waste records
- Compliance exports
  This data represents operational history and may be retained for regulatory, safety, or audit purposes, even if a user account is deleted.
  Facility operators remain responsible for the legal accuracy and interpretation of this data.

---

## Data Retention

### Personal Data

Retained while your account is active. You may request deletion.

### Facility Operational Data

Certain records are retained indefinitely or for legally required periods, including:

- Audit logs
- Verification records
- Deviation reports
- Compliance documentation
  These records are not removed when a user account is deleted, as they form part of facility operational history.

---

## Deletion Rights (Important Clarification)

You may delete:

- your personal profile
- personal grows
- community content

You may not delete:

- facility audit logs
- compliance records
- operational verifications
- deviation history
  These records are immutable for safety and compliance reasons.

---

## Data Sharing

We may share data with:

- Infrastructure providers (hosting, payments)
- Regulatory or legal authorities when required
- Facility administrators for operational oversight
  We do not sell personal data.

---

## Compliance Disclaimer

GrowPath AI provides tooling only.
GrowPath AI is not a regulatory authority, and does not certify legal compliance. Facilities are responsible for:

- how data is used
- how compliance reports are interpreted
- meeting jurisdictional requirements

---

## International & Regulatory Transfers

Data may be processed globally with appropriate safeguards.

---

## Children’s Privacy

GrowPath AI is intended for adults in jurisdictions where cultivation is legal.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as platform capabilities evolve.

---

## Why This Matters

Your original policy promised:
“You can delete everything.”
Your system requires:
“Some data must never be deleted.”
Without this correction, you’d be legally committing to behavior your own backend must refuse.
That’s how platforms get sued.

---

## The Core Shift

Old privacy mindset:
“We are a SaaS app.”

Your real privacy model:
“We are an operating system handling compliance-grade operational records.”

Which means:

- different retention rules
- different deletion rights
- different liability framing

---

## Final Verdict

Your original policy is acceptable for MVP marketing.
The corrected policy is:

- legally aligned with your architecture
- consistent with immutable records
- safe for regulated operations
- future-proof for real facilities

In other words:
Old policy = startup app
New policy = real platform

And GrowPath is very clearly the second one now.
GrowPath AI is not intended for users under 21 years of age in jurisdictions where cannabis cultivation is legal, or 18+ elsewhere. We do not knowingly collect data from children.

## Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services. You may request deletion at any time.

## International Data Transfers

Your data may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy periodically. We will notify you of significant changes via email or in-app notification.
