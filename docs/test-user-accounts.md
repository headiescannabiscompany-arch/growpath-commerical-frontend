# Test User Accounts for QA

Use these accounts to test all entitlement flows and user experiences for each role/tier:

| Role       | Email                   | Password  |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| Free       | free@growpath.com       | Test1234! |
| Pro        | pro@growpath.com        | Test1234! |
| Influencer | influencer@growpath.com | Test1234! |
| Commercial | commercial@growpath.com | Test1234! |
| Facility   | facility@growpath.com   | Test1234! |

- All accounts use the same password for convenience.
- Ensure each account is assigned the correct role in your backend or authentication provider.
- Update the backend seed or admin panel as needed to create these users before testing.
